# The puppet module tool does url joins improperly. When we send it a path to a
# file like "/pulp/puppet/demo/system/releases/p/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib-3.1.0.tar.gz",
# it treats that like a relative path instead of absolute. The following redirect
# compensates for this. The only path that should be available under
# /pulp_puppet/forge/ is /pulp_puppet/forge/<consumer|repository>/consumer_id|repo_id>/api/v1/releases.json
# and so the following redirect will match any path that isn't the above.
