class Unit(object):
    """
    Represents a unit for purposes of generating dependency data equivalent to
    the Puppet Forge API's output.

    Note that the requested module will only have one version present in the
    output, even if multiple versions exist. I don't know why, but this is how
    the original API behaves.

    Also, when an included module has dependencies, all available versions of
    that module will be included; even versions that do not meet the dependency's
    version requirement. Again, I don't know why, but this is how the original
    API behaves.

    Unlike the examples below which are taken from Puppet Forge, we return full
    URLs to each file so that the basic auth credentials get stripped off.

    A basic example with no dependencies will look like this:

    http://forge.puppetlabs.com/api/v1/releases.json?module=puppetlabs/stdlib

    {
      "puppetlabs/stdlib": [
        {
          "dependencies": [],
          "version": "3.2.0",
          "file": "/system/releases/p/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib-3.2.0.tar.gz"
        }
      ]
    }

    An example with dependencies will look like this (many versions of stdlib
    were removed for brevity):

    http://forge.puppetlabs.com/api/v1/releases.json?module=branan/minecraft

    {
      "branan/minecraft": [
