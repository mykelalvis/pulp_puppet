Pulp 2.4.0
==========

New Features
------------

-  Install and update operations can now be performed with puppet version 3.3+
   against a pulp repository. See :ref:`install_post_33`.

-  Pulp's puppet distributor is now updated to publish to /var/lib/pulp/puppet
   instead of /var/www/pulp_puppet.

API Changes
-----------

* The sync progress report's modules section has changed the way it reports
  errors with individual modules. The ``modules`` sub-object has an
  ``individual_errors`` attribute that used to index a JSON object, with module
  names (including version) as keys. Pulp stores this data structure in
  MongoDB, which led to 
  `RHBZ #1072580 <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1072580>`_
  because the module versions use periods which are illegal
  characters to use as document keys. The ``individual_errors`` attribute now
  indexes a list of JSON objects, and each JSON object has these keys: ``module``
  (which is formatted as "name-version"), ``author``, ``exception``, and
  ``traceback``. ``individual_errors`` used to be null when there weren't any
  errors, but would be an object if there were errors. Now ``individual_errors``
  will always be an array. It will be empty when there are no errors.
