Pulp 2.5 Release Notes
======================

Pulp 2.5.0
==========

The 2.5.0 release of ``pulp-puppet`` is a minor update release with bugfixes
and two new features.

    * The ``--skip-dep`` and ``--modulepath`` flags are now supported during install and update
      operations.

    * A new SELinux boolean named ``pulp_manage_puppet`` is introduced for the Install Distributor.
      It works with the new SELinux policy introduced in Pulp Platform 2.5.0. Read more in the
      Plugin Configuration section of the Pulp Puppet Technical Reference for more details on
      this new boolean.

Users upgrading from 2.3.x or earlier will need to manually delete the
``/var/www/pulp_puppet`` directory after upgrading. This is the old location
for puppet module publishing in Pulp 2.3 but is no longer used. The directory
should be empty after the migration is complete.
